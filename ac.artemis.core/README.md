## Welcome to Artemis Core!

This project is split in 3 different versions:
- Artemis Core 3.0.0 (severely outdated, to deprecate)
- Artemis Core 4.0.0 (outdated, still quite used though)
- Artemis Core 5.0.0 (Latest)

It is important that from here on out, you must follow a Interface-Implementation-Factory coding style. If something is 
a feature, it belongs in the feature package. Else, if it is more of a general system, it deserves a package it can call 
home. 

**Under no condition should any algorithm which is subject to changes should not follow such pattern code.**
